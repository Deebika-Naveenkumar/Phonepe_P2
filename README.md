Lanuage & Tool used: Python, Streamlit, SQL, Pandas

Introduction:

The aim of this project is to develop a solution that extracts, transforms, and visualizes data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository

Features:

Data Extraction: Clone the Github to fetch the data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository.

Data Transformation: Use a scripting language such as Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data.
This may include cleaning the data and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.

Database Insertion: Use the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL commands.

Dashboard Creation: Using Streamlit and Plotly to build an interactive dashboard. Plotly's built-in geo map functions can be used to display the data on a map and Streamlit can be used to create a user-friendly interface.

Data Retrieval: Fetching data from the database to dynamically update the dashboard.
